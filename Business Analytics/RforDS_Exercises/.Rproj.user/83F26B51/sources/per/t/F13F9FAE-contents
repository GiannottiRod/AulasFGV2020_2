# Capitulo 13

## Inicialização

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr) # mais pipes, como %<>%
library(lubridate) # melhor manejo de datas
library(maps)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr) # mais pipes, como %<>%
library(lubridate) # melhor manejo de datas
library(maps)
```

Para o capitulo 13 também utilizaremos a biblioteca de voos de NYC
```{r}
library(nycflights13)
# ?flights
# View(flights)
head(flights)
```

## Exercícios

## 13.2 nycflights13

### 13.2.1
Imagine you wanted to draw (approximately) the route each plane flies from its origin to its destination. What variables would you need? What tables would you need to combine?

### 13.2.2
I forgot to draw the relationship between weather and airports. What is the relationship and how should it appear in the diagram?

### 13.2.3
weather only contains information for the origin (NYC) airports. If it contained weather records for all airports in the USA, what additional relation would it define with flights?

### 13.2.4
We know that some days of the year are “special”, and fewer people than usual fly on them. How might you represent that data as a data frame? What would be the primary keys of that table? How would it connect to the existing tables?

\newpage

## 13.3 Keys

### 13.3.1
Add a surrogate key to flights.

### 13.3.2
Identify the keys in the following datasets

#### 13.3.2.1

Lahman::Batting

#### 13.3.2.2

babynames::babynames

#### 13.3.2.3

nasaweather::atmos

#### 13.3.2.4

fueleconomy::vehicles

#### 13.3.2.5

ggplot2::diamonds

(You might need to install some packages and read some documentation.)

### 13.3.3
Draw a diagram illustrating the connections between the Batting, Master, and Salaries tables in the Lahman package. Draw another diagram that shows the relationship between Master, Managers, AwardsManagers.

### 13.3.4
How would you characterise the relationship between the Batting, Pitching, and Fielding tables?

\newpage

## 13.4 Mutating joins

### 13.4.1
Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the airports data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Here’s an easy way to draw a map of the United States:

```{r}
airports %>%
  semi_join(flights, c("faa" = "dest")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
    borders("state") +
    geom_point() +
    coord_quickmap()
# Don’t worry if you don’t understand what semi_join() does — you’ll learn about it next.
# You might want to use the size or colour of the points to display the average delay for each airport.
```

### 13.4.2
Add the location of the origin and destination (i.e. the lat and lon) to flights.

### 13.4.3
Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?

### 13.4.4
What weather conditions make it more likely to see a delay?

### 13.4.5
What happened on June 13 2013? Display the spatial pattern of delays, and then use Google to cross-reference with the weather.

\newpage

## 13.5 Filtering joins

### 13.5.1
What does it mean for a flight to have a missing tailnum? What do the tail numbers that don’t have a matching record in planes have in common? (Hint: one variable explains ~90% of the problems.)

### 13.5.2
Filter flights to only show flights with planes that have flown at least 100 flights.

### 13.5.3
Combine fueleconomy::vehicles and fueleconomy::common to find only the records for the most common models.

### 13.5.4
Find the 48 hours (over the course of the whole year) that have the worst delays. Cross-reference it with the weather data. Can you see any patterns?

### 13.5.5
What does anti_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) tell you? What does anti_join(airports, flights, by = c("faa" = "dest")) tell you?

### 13.5.6
You might expect that there’s an implicit relationship between plane and airline, because each plane is flown by a single airline. Confirm or reject this hypothesis using the tools you’ve learned above.
